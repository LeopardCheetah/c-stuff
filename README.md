# CS Stuff (the theory part)
    
A place to put all the theoretical stuff I learned, where I try to implement data structures and algorithms in c (and python if I can figure out how memory management works on that).      
Roadmap taken from [here](https://roadmap.sh).  
Note that I am using the CS Pathway.
