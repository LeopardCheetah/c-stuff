i have no clue what this was

anyways,

time to try and implement some stuff - the "basics" of coding


- [ ] array
- [ ] heap
- [ ] graph
- [ ] tree
- [ ] stack
- [ ] queue
- [ ] linked list
- [ ] hashed map/dict in python
- [ ] string

from here everything else can mostly be done in python as py has an easier syntax and this would just be a different language to represent the same idea
